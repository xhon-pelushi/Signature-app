# Signature App - Setup Instructions

## ✅ Project Status: WORKING

The Signature App is now fully functional! Here's what was fixed and how to run it:

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing Dependencies**: Installed all required npm packages
2. **Environment Variables**: Created `.env.local` with proper configuration
3. **Database Setup**: Configured Prisma with SQLite database
4. **Test Issues**: Fixed failing test case
5. **Build Process**: Verified the application builds and runs correctly

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies** (already done):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment is configured** (`.env.local` already created):
   ```bash
   # Environment variables are set up
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-here-please-change-in-production
   DATABASE_URL="file:./prisma/dev.db"
   ```

3. **Database is ready** (migrations already run):
   ```bash
   npm run prisma:generate
   npm run prisma:migrate
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser**:
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Available Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with Turbopack
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run typecheck` - TypeScript type checking
- `npm run lint` - ESLint linting
- `npm test` - Run test suite
- `npm run check:health` - Run all checks (typecheck + lint + test)

## Features Working

✅ **PDF Upload & Viewer**: Drag & drop PDF upload with preview  
✅ **Digital Signatures**: Draw, type, or upload signature images  
✅ **Document Editing**: Place signatures and form fields anywhere on PDFs  
✅ **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile  
✅ **Database Integration**: SQLite database with Prisma ORM  
✅ **Authentication**: NextAuth.js integration  
✅ **Testing**: Full test suite passing  

## First Time Setup

When you first visit the app, you'll be redirected to `/setup` to configure:
- Organization name
- Email settings (SMTP)
